  summary: get subcategories
  description: |
    This operation returns the requested category's children (aka subcategories).

    It is important to note that the number of subcategories returned is dependent on the configured value for that category.
    If a lower number is specified than there are children, then the list will be truncated to that number.

    This is defined by the `subCategoriesPerPage` key in the category's hash.
