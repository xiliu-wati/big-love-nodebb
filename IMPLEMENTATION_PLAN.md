├── AuthState (User authentication)
├── ForumsState (Forum list and selection)
├── MessagesState (Messages for selected forum)
├── UIState (Sidebar, theme, responsive)
└── ConnectionState (WebSocket, network status)
```

### Component Hierarchy
```

│   │   └── NavigationMenu
│   └── MainContent
│       ├── ForumHeader
│       ├── MessagesList
│       └── MessageInput
└── Overlays (Modals, Dialogs, etc.)
```

### Folder Structure

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- [ ] App startup time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Message send time < 500ms
- [ ] Smooth scrolling at 60fps
- [ ] Memory usage < 150MB average

### User Experience Goals
- [ ] Intuitive navigation (< 3 taps to any feature)
- [ ] Responsive design across all screen sizes
- [ ] Accessible to users with disabilities
- [ ] Offline functionality for core features

### Feature Completion
- [ ] 100% feature parity with design document
- [ ] All major user flows tested and working
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases covered
- [ ] Performance optimized for production

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex state management**: Use proven patterns (Riverpod)
- **Real-time performance**: Implement with efficient WebSocket handling
- **Media handling**: Use established packages with caching

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature creep**: Stick to defined MVP for each phase
- **Technical debt**: Regular code reviews and refactoring
- **Testing delays**: Integrate testing throughout development

### Resource Risks
- **API dependencies**: Mock APIs for development
- **Third-party packages**: Have fallback alternatives
- **Platform differences**: Test on both iOS and Android regularly

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building the Telegram-style forum app with manageable phases and clear deliverables.
